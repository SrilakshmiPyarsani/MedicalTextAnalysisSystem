# 🩺 Medical Text Analysis System
## Overview
The Medical Text Analysis System is a cutting-edge platform that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simplify and automate insights extraction from complex medical texts. Built using advanced machine learning models like PubMedBERT and frameworks such as Streamlit, this system addresses key challenges in processing healthcare data for clinicians, researchers, and healthcare professionals.
Features
## 🌟 Core Functionalities
1.	Text Summarization
o	Summarizes lengthy medical abstracts into concise and clinically relevant overviews using PubMedBERT.
2.	Named Entity Recognition (NER)
o	Extracts critical medical entities (diseases, medications, procedures) using a biomedical NER model.
3.	Interactive Q&A System
o	Provides real-time answers to medical questions using a locally deployed Ollama server with the Llama 2 model.
4.	Multilingual Translation
o	Translates medical text into multiple languages using the Google Translation API, improving accessibility worldwide.
5.	Sentiment Analysis
o	Analyzes sentiments in medical texts to provide actionable insights and visualize them with intuitive charts.

## System Architecture
The system is built on a three-layer modular architecture:
1.	Input Layer:
o	Supports multiple formats like PDF, TXT, and ZIP files for flexible data ingestion.
2.	Core Processing Layer:
o	Incorporates pre-trained models like PubMedBERT for summarization, d4data/biomedical-ner-all for NER, and Hugging Face pipelines for sentiment analysis.
3.	Integration Layer:
o	A user-friendly Streamlit web interface ensures seamless visualization and interaction with insights.
